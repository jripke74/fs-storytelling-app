    <!-- Step 1
    In this workshop, you will build a storytelling app that allows users to select a 
    type of story and display a short story of that type. The CSS and the HTML 
    boilerplate has been provided for you.

    Begin by creating an h1 element and give it a text Want to hear a short story?. 
    -->
    <h1>Want to hear a short story?</h1>

    <!-- Step 2
    Create a main element with a class of story-container. Inside the story-container, 
    create a div with a class of btn-container. 
    -->
    <main class="story-container">
      <div class="btn-container">
        <!-- Step 3
        Inside the .btn-container , create three buttons for each type of story. Give each 
        button a class of btn and an id of scary-btn, funny-btn, and adventure-btn. The text 
        for each button should be Scary Story, Funny Story, and Adventure Story respectively. 
        -->
        <button id="scary-btn" class="btn">Scary Story</button>
        <button id="funny-btn" class="btn">Funny Story</button>
        <button id="adventure-btn" class="btn">Adventure Story</button>
      </div>
      <!-- Step 4
      Below the .btn-container div, you should have a p element with the id of result. This is 
      where the story will be displayed. 
      -->
      <p id="result"></p>
    </main>
    <!-- Step 5
    Next, you will start working on the JavaScript. For that, begin by linking the script.js file 
    to your HTML. 
    -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
